# ShoppingGUI

• Personal project created to explore the capabilities and my knowledge of the graphical user interface 

• Utilizes frames, panels, text fields, dropdown menu, buttons, labels, and various other components to create a user friendly shopping window

• Users will be brought to a pop up window to view and select various rare collectables at different prices 

• Limited to one item per user to represent realistic shopping restrictions
